# Poll Checker
A simple Python project that collects US election polling data for quick
viewing. It is limited to RealClearPolitics (RCP) averages by design,
not comprehensive data analysis with margins of error, pollster ratings, etc.

Be sure to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before trying to run the
`polls.py` script.
